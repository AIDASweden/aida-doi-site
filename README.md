# doi-bils-site
PHP and XSLT code to generate:

1. An index page with a list of the DOIs issued by BILS (SND.BILS)
2. A landing page for each issued DOI

Pages are automatically generated from the DOI metadata available at DataCite (and crossref for referenced articles), as well as a local json file (issued_dois.json) that holds the link to the data set files refered to by the DOI.


## index page
Generated by XSLT transforming the xml returned by querying DataCite for datacenter=SND.BILS. 

## Landing pages
Generated by XSLT transforming the xml returned by querying DataCite for the specified DOI. Links to data set files are taken from the issued_dois.json file. Referenced articles are taken from querying crossref for information.

## issued_dois.json
This is the only file that has to updated when new DOIs are issued. For each DOI, one or more links has to be defined to the data sets for which the DOI is issued.
