# doi-bils-site PHP and XSLT code to generate:

1. An index page with a list of the DOIs issued by BILS (SND.BILS)
2. A landing page for each issued DOI

Pages are automatically generated from the DOI metadata available at DataCite
(and crossref for referenced articles), as well as a local json file
(issued_dois.json) that holds the link to the data set files refered to by the
DOI.

## index page
Generated by XSLT transforming the xml returned by querying
DataCite for datacenter=SND.BILS.

## Landing pages
Generated by XSLT transforming the xml returned by querying
DataCite for the specified DOI. Links to data set files are taken from the
issued_dois.json file (see below). Referenced articles are taken from querying
crossref for information.

## Links to data sets
This information is taken from a file that must be accessible as **data/issued_dois.json** -
it is available as a *separate* git repo *[doi-bils-site-data](https://github.com/BILS/doi-bils-site-data)*.

## Server update
Update scripts are available in a separate _private_ git repo *doi-bils-site-scripts*.
